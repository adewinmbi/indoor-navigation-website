## How to Replicate

There are some very specific build settings I used to allow this WebGL build to run on Firefox with Github Pages. I've documented them here.

These settings can be found under Player Settings.
* **Resolution and Presentation**: 
  * Width = 960
  * Height = 600
  * Run in background = true
* **Other Settings**:
  * Color Space = gamma
* **Publishing Settings**:
  * Compression Format = Gzip

Here are the Github Pages settings.
* Source = Deploy from a branch
* Branch = main (with /(root) folder)
